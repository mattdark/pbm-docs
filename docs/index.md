# Percona Backup for MongoDB Documentation

Percona Backup for MongoDB is an open-source, distributed and low-impact solution for consistent backups of [MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets](deployments.md).

As of version 1.7.0, Percona Backup for MongoDB supports both [physical and logical backups and restores](details/backup-types.md). [Point-in-Time recovery](usage/point-in-time-recovery.md) is currently supported only for logical backups.

[^1]: Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful). This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA.
