# Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.0.0 (2022-09-21)

| Release date | September 21, 2022  |
|------------- | ---------------|
| Installation | [Installing Percona Backup for MongoDB](../installation.md) |

Percona Backup for MongoDB is a distributed, low-impact solution for consistent backups of MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets. This is a tool for creating consistent backups across a MongoDB sharded cluster (or a non-sharded replica set), and for restoring
those backups to a specific point in time.

## Release Highlights

* Use physical backups and restores enables in production environments with this functionality becoming generally available.
* Comply to security regulations in terms of [data-at-rest encryption when making physical backups and restores](../usage/restore.md#physical-restores-with-data-at-rest-encryption).
* Understand how your physical restores are going and timely react to the process by [tracking physical restore progress](../usage/restore-progress.md).
* Work only with the desired subset of data by making [selective logical backups and restores](../usage/selective-backup.md) (tech preview feature). Thereby you reduce time on database maintenance and save on storage costs. 


## New Features

* [PBM-790](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PBM-790): Add the ability to make selective backups and restores. This is the tech preview feature [^1]

This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA.
